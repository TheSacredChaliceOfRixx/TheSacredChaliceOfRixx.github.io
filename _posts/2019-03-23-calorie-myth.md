Being interested in health and fitness, I tend to selectively notice articles telling me I've been doing everything wrong.

One thing that keeps cropping up in my information feeds are articles declaring the uselessness of calories and calorie counting for body weight loss. It seems to me that these articles all follow the same pattern:
1. They assume if something isn't perfect, it's no use at all.

1. They suggest an alternative, which is either just another way of doing the same thing, or is something even worse.

Such an article I read recently was "[Death of the calorie](https://www.1843magazine.com/features/death-of-the-calorie)" by Peter Wilson. It has the following characteristics, often typical of such articles:

* Relies heavily on an anecdote describing the experience of a single person.
* Describes how inaccurate calorie labels can be, therefore they are useless.
* Ignores that calories labels are just one piece of data that should not be used in isolation of everything else, for example, the other items on the food label.
* Suggests that instead of using calories, we should be doing other things, things that any knowledgeable person would do anyway _in addition_ to calorie counting, such as reducing sugar intake. 
    * This is the logical fallacy of a false dilemma: you don't have to do either one or the other exclusively; you can do both.
* Says that 80% of people who attempt to lose weight fail, which is true, but neglects to examine why this is, and what the 20% who succeed do. Instead the author simply assumes that calorie counting cannot work because most people who try it fail, conveniently ignoring similar, if not worse, failure rates for everyone who tries other methods of weight loss.

The author seems to think that they have made a new discovery. Calorie skeptics have been writing articles like this for decades. At least to the author's credit, they do not put the scientific notion of energy equations or thermodynamics into doubt.

Let's examine some of these claims.

Cherry Picking
--------------

The author goes on for some time explaining that calorie calculation methods and food labels are not exact. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration allows for a 20% margin of error when producers label energy values. That means a food could have up to 20% more calories than what the producer has printed on the label. This and other variances make counting calories useless.

This is an obvious case of cherry-picking data:
* Yes, foods could have up to 20% more calories, but also 20% fewer calories than on the label.
* Application of the [law of large numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers) would mean that if the inaccuracies result from random errors, over time and by consuming a variety of foods, the results would average out. This is really what counts: not a person's caloric intake for one piece of food on one day, but for all food intake over weeks, months, years.
* Even if there is a systematic bias, where food manufacturers generally underestimate the caloric content of their products for marketing reasoning, a thinking person can easily overcome this. Just add a 20% buffer to your calorie intake.
* Most scientific mainstream advice recommends having a daily 500 kcal deficit to consistently lose weight. This should be enough to compensate for errors in the long run, which is what really counts.

We Already Know about the Thermic Effect of Food
----------------------------------------------------

The author seems to think scientists and health agencies do not know that different kinds of food take more or less energy to digest. Scientists have known this for a long time. Indeed, many publications describe, document, and analyze the [thermic effect of food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_dynamic_action). However researchers have failed to [consistently find](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7733021) that this makes a significant difference in weight management.


We also Know What You Eat is Important
--------------------------------------

The article makes a great deal about the experience of the one person's struggle to lose weight by calorie counting, and their success when they change their diet to cut out sugar, processed foods, and the like. Instead of calories, according to the author's anecdote, they focused on "quality" foods and maintaining a balanced, well rounded diet along with a sustainable sports regime.

Well, that's what everyone recommends anyway. That's why there are other items on food labels below the energy information. There are entries for sugar and saturated fat, which should be avoided, and protein and fiber, which increase satiety and are associated with other beneficial health outcomes. 

This appears to be the logical fallacy of a [false dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_dilemma). We don't have to choose _either_ calorie counting _or_ selectively eating foods to promote weight loss. We can do both. In fact we _should_ do both, and more.

What do the 20% do?
-------------------

Although the author states that 80% of people who try to lose weight do not, they never examine what the people who succeed do. The [National Weight Control Registry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Weight_Control_Registry) does this. To quote a portion of their [summarized findings](http://nwcr.ws/Research/default.htm):

> There is variety in how NWCR members keep the weight off. Most report continuing to maintain a low calorie, low fat diet and doing high levels of activity.

Being Pedantic
--------------

I know people in glass houses... but I can't resist. The author makes an error when defining calories. The error is not really relevant in the context of the article but it still bothered me. They [write](https://www.1843magazine.com/features/death-of-the-calorie) "one calorie is the energy required to heat 1kg of water by one degree Celsius". Actually one *Calorie* (with a capitalized "C"), also known as one kilocalorie (kcal), [does this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calorie). One big "C" Calorie is 1000 small "c" calories.

Conclusion
----------

Did Mark Twain really quip "the reports of my death are greatly exaggerated."? Or is that [just another myth](http://www.thisdayinquotes.com/2010/06/reports-of-my-death-are-greatly.html)?
