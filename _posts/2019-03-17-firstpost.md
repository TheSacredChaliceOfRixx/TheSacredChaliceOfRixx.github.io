[The Sacred Chalice of Rixx](about)

**Hello universe**, this is my first Jekyll blog post.

I created these pages and this blog mostly to test out GitHub's Jekyll integration. All went smoothly when I followed these instructions:

* https://pages.github.com

However I could not get a Jekyll theme to generate, as described in [the GitHub documentation](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-jekyll-theme-to-your-github-pages-site-with-the-jekyll-theme-chooser). The solution:
1. I deleted the index.html file.
1. In its place, I created a markdown index.md file and pushed my changes.

After that, bliss.
